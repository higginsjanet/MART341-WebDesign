<h1>The tale of Two Cities</h1>
<h2>Charles Dickens</h2>
<hr />

<p>I was in fifth grade when I started reading the classics like <em>Twenty
  Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Moby Dick, The Last of the Mohicans</em> and
<em>The Tale of Two Cities</em>.</p>
<p>Nothing has effected me more than <em>The Tale of Two Cities</em>.</p>
<p> I love the start of the book:<br />
  <em>
     It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
      it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch
       of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
        it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything
         before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,
         we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far
         like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted
         on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree
         of comparison only.</em>
       </p>
       <p>I wept profusely and memorized the verse that was quoted:John 11:25 <em>"Jesus said to her,
         I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he
         should die, shall live."</em></p>

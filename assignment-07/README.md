# Janet Higgins' MART341-WebDesign
Repository for my Introduction to Web Design & Development Homework.

Week 2 was more understandable. I reviewed week 1 material and went through the tutorial of building a web-projects test-cite. I couldn't get the button to work and the tutorial didn't show me the js file.

1. Browsers: A Web browser is actually a software application that runs on your Internet-connected computer. It allows you to view Web pages, as well as use other content and technologies such as video, graphics files, and digital certificates, to name a few. I use mainly chrome and will install firefox.
2. A markup language: In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The most common mark up language is html which is used to display pages on the web.

# Assignment 5
## Janet Higgins
1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? I went to Amazon.com site. What did it look like? It had a row of tabs on the top and menus down the left and right. Too much information!  How has it changed? No side menus, and large pictures of items of personal interest.
2. Summarize your experience with these last few topics. What did you learn? I am learning how to use ATOM and GitHub. What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood? I have never used something like GitHub. I have used Notepad for developing HTML pages. 
3. An embedded image of your screenshot using its relative URL.

# Assignment 6
## Janet Higgins

1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? There can be only one of each. There must be one of each.

2. How are these elements different, or what role do they play? The head contains information such as author, description, and on how the page should be rendered along with a title and other elements that 
define the page such as script and links to CSS files. The body is what the user will see and has html markup. 

3. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements such as: Headings,
Paragraphs, Breaks, and Lists. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place emphasis on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being strong. They can also provide citations or quotations, or link to definitions. 

4. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes this week.  How did you overcome your challenges? I learned much more about semantic markup that I didn't know.

# Assignment 7
## Janet Higgins

1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve? Oh, the most common form is the Google text search form. I use the text search forms on a lot of sites to quickly find what I am loking for. 
2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage.
	Text:  Net ID: <input type="text" name="name" id="test-text" /> allows user to input text
	Selection: restrict the user's choices. the ones I used were the checkbox and the radio selections.
	Button input: The input button sends the information either by a get or post method. The action usually sends the information to a server.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. I read through the tutorials and do a quick read of the assignment. For the web pages: I first chose a topic. I create an assignment, images, and pages folder. I look on the web and in my photos for images. 
	I use Photoshop to find out the images sizes and resize if necessary and save as png files. I use a template I have stored as a text file for creating the index and other pages. I study the assignment pdf to 
	fulfill the assignment.

  <p><cite><strong>If I Knew You were a Comin'</strong><br />Sesame Street version</cite><br /><br />
    Come in!<br />
Well, well, well. Look who's here.<br />
I haven't seen you in many a year.<br /><br />

If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, baked a cake, baked a cake<br />
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake<br />
Howdya do, howdya do, howdya do?<br /><br />

Had you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band, grandest band in the land<br />
Had you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band<br />
And spread the welcome mat for you<br /><br />

Oh, I don't know where you came from<br />
'Cause I don't know where you've been<br />
But it really doesn't matter<br />
Grab a chair and fill your platter<br />
And dig, dig, dig right in<br /><br />

If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, hired a band, goodness sake!<br />
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake<br />
Howdya do, howdya do, howdya do?<br /><br />

        <strong>Eileen Barton</strong></a> (November 24, 1924 â€“ June 27, 2006) was an American singer best known for her 1950 hit song,
        "If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake." At age 15, she appeared as a guest singer on a Johnny Mercer
         variety series, leading to her being noticed by Frank Sinatra, who took her under his wing and put her
         in a regular spot on the CBS radio show that he hosted in the 1940s. She co-starred on Sinatra's show
         beginning August 16, 1944, and was also part of Sinatra's act at the Paramount Theater in
         15 appearances there. She also appeared on her own and as a guest performer with such stars as
         Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, and Danny Kaye.<br />

         In 1945, Barton had her own radio program, Teen Timers. That November, the program's name was
         changed to The Eileen Barton Show. It was broadcast Saturday mornings on NBC. In 1954, she starred
         in The Eileen Barton Show, a 13-episode transcribed program for the United States Marine Corps.

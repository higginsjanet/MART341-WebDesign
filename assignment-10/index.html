	The nineteen sixties began with the election of the first president born in the twentieth century -- John Kennedy. For many Americans, 
	the young president represented a spirit of hope for the nation. When Kennedy was murdered in nineteen sixty-three, many felt that their 
	hopes died, too. This was especially true of young people, and members and supporters of minority groups.
   	<br /><br/>
	In addition to President Kennedy, two other influential Americans were murdered during the nineteen sixties. Civil rights leader 
	Martin Luther King Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee, in nineteen sixty-eight. Several weeks later, 
	Robert Kennedy -- John Kennedy's brother -- was shot in Los Angeles, California. He was campaigning to win his party's nomination for president.

	The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve superior 
	spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II. The 
	technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for national security, and mixed with the 
	symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race led to pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes to the 
	Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.

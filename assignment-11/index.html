        The world-symbolism of music cannot be exhaustively interpreted through language,
        because it symbolically refers to the primal contradiction and the primal suffering
        within the primal Oneness, and thus symbolizes a sphere beyond and prior to all phenomena.
        In comparison with this, all phenomena are mere symbols: hence language, as the organ and
        symbol of phenomena, can never uncover the innermost core of music but, once it attempts to
        imitate music, always remains in superficial contact with it, and no amount of lyrical eloquence
        can bring its deepest meaning a step closer.

  Singing and dancing, man expresses himself as a member of a higher community: he has
	forgotten how to walk and talk, and is about to fly dancing into the heavens. His gestures
	express enchantment. Just as the animals now speak, and the earth yields up milk and honey,
	he now gives voice to supernatural sounds: he feels like a god, he himself now walks about
	enraptured and elated as he saw the gods walk in dreams. Man is no longer an artist, he has
	become a work of art: the artistic power of the whole of nature reveals itself to the supreme
	gratification of the primal Oneness amidst the paroxysms of intoxication. The noblest clay,
	the most precious marble, man, is kneaded and hewn here, and to the chisel-blows of the Dionysiac
	 world-artist there echoes the cry of the Eleusinian mysteries, ‘Do you bow low, multitudes? Do you sense the Creator, world?’

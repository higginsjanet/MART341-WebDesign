# Janet Higgins' MART341-WebDesign
Repository for my Introduction to Web Design & Development Homework.

Week 2 was more understandable. I reviewed week 1 material and went through the tutorial of building a web-projects test-cite. I couldn't get the button to work and the tutorial didn't show me the js file.

# Assignment 3

Three things I learned this week.
*I have learned more about the Internet
*I learned about the parts of an URL
*I learned about Atom

# Assignment 4

1. Browsers: A Web browser is actually a software application that runs on your Internet-connected computer. It allows you to view Web pages, as well as use other content and technologies such as video, graphics files, and digital certificates, to name a few. I use mainly chrome and will install firefox.
2. A markup language: In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The most common mark up language is html which is used to display pages on the web.



# Assignment 5
## Janet Higgins
1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? I went to Amazon.com site. What did it look like? It had a row of tabs on the top and menus down the left and right. Too much information!  How has it changed? No side menus, and large pictures of items of personal interest.
2. Summarize your experience with these last few topics. What did you learn? I am learning how to use ATOM and GitHub. What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood? I have never used something like GitHub. I have used Notepad for developing HTML pages.
3. An embedded image of your screenshot using its relative URL.



# Assignment 6
## Janet Higgins

1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? There can be only one of each. There must be one of each.

2. How are these elements different, or what role do they play? The head contains information such as author, description, and on how the page should be rendered along with a title and other elements that
define the page such as script and links to CSS files. The body is what the user will see and has html markup.

3. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements such as: Headings,
Paragraphs, Breaks, and Lists. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place emphasis on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being strong. They can also provide citations or quotations, or link to definitions.

4. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes this week.  How did you overcome your challenges? I learned much more about semantic markup that I didn't know.

# Assignment 7
## Janet Higgins

1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve? Oh, the most common form is the Google text search form. I use the text search forms on a lot of sites to quickly find what I am loking for.
2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage.
	Text:  Net ID: <input type="text" name="name" id="test-text" /> allows user to input text
	Selection: restrict the user's choices. the ones I used were the checkbox and the radio selections.
	Button input: The input button sends the information either by a get or post method. The action usually sends the information to a server.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. I read through the tutorials and do a quick read of the assignment. For the web pages: I first chose a topic. I create an assignment, images, and pages folder. I look on the web and in my photos for images.
	I use Photoshop to find out the images sizes and resize if necessary and save as png files. I use a template I have stored as a text file for creating the index and other pages. I study the assignment pdf to
	fulfill the assignment.

# Assignment 8
## Janet Higgins

1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
	The div: The <div>...</div> element offers developers a block-level element to group other elements together.

	Classes: The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value. This allows for easy styling of these elements with same CSS code.

	The id: the “id” attribute takes as its value a string, which should be a unique identifier to that specific element. I think of the id as another form of
	a comment about what something will do on the page such as what a div is going to do.

	Spans: The span element is the inline equivalent of the <div> element.  the <span> element is to identify text that needs to appear visually unique on the rendered HTML page.


2. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos? I use YouTube for housing big videos I can't run on my laptop. I tried to use an iframe for the video
	I used for the page but YouTube wouldn't allow it. So I downloaded a copy from YouTube and intend to add it to my assignment 8 media files. I have a hosting service that hosts
	the two websites I maintain that allows me to upload videos. I notice that you use services for your videos.

3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you overcome them?
	I think that the biggest challenge was having to download from YouTube and ITunes for the video and sound files since I
	didn't care to use a different service that would charge me money every month just to down load for "free" a song.

# Assignment 9
## Janet Higgins

1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
	HTML is not hard to learn but the CSS is. I am sure that I am using too much redundancy in the CSS style.

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
	I think I would like to simplify the CSS. I really am excited learning more CSS.

3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?
	I think that the challenge was in figuring out the CSS to use the unordered list as an inline and as the usual look in the list. I made a class for the navigation list. I still struggle with
	centering in a table. I just created an empty table data column to push the form to the center.

# Assignment 10
## Janet Higgins

1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When
might you choose one over the other to style content?

The universal selector is used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is the star (*). The star is often used in computer science to mean “all.”

The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name (the reserved keyword placed in the opening tag of an element).

Class names assigned to HTML elements via the class="" attribute can also be used to style elements. To select class elements, prepend a dot (.) to the front of the class name in the CSS.

Using class selectors is a great way to select elements that serve the same function.

Just like the class selector, the ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.
ID names are prepended with a number sign (#).


2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB
values, or hex codes.
I chose 4 colors used in fashion in the 1960s:
Grenadine rgb(198,56,52) #c63834
Mellow Yellow rgb(252,209,114) #fcd172
Liquid Blue rgb(98,184,207) #62b8cf
Dusty Green rgb(96,230,147) #54cf82

and a gray for the page background and background for Paragraph
rgb(15,188,236) #0fbcec



3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I really wanted to use the four colors as independent overlapping layers as you can see in the center. But
I found out I couldn't use a z-index so I just did the 4 color mix in photoshop and saved as
a jpg.

# Assignment 11
## Janet Higgins

1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
	The system fonts are on the user's computer, web fonts are linked to the web page from another site, web-safe
	fonts are only the fonts that are in common to different operating systems.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
	Just in case your choice doesn't load or loads slow, the fallback fonts will be loaded in
	the order of the font stack.

3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.
	The <p> in the first paragraph wouldn't show the firstchild css. I discovered that it was having the title
	in the same container. As soon as I separated the title in its own div and the first paragraph in its own div it worked.

# Assignment 12
## Janet HIGGINS

1. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
The content is in a box and is padded from the border of the box. The box is actually the size of the border and its distance from other boxes is determined by the margins.

2. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I think the hardest thing was trying to center a smaller box containing a table. I more or less cheated by making the left margin very large. This solution won't look good when the page is resized.

# Assignment 13
## Janet HIGGINS

1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
My imaginary client is "Cakes by the Slice". They needed a way to tell people what they were selling and how to find it.
2. Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?
A lot of their clients will be using mobile devices to locate their cake van since it is mobile.
3. Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them
After carefully reading and going over all of the topics previously covered, I was still at a loss how to implement the site. The more I tried, the more messed up the index page got and the nav bar was more than terrible. Sorry, I needed to use your example pages to make any sense of the new materials. I then could realize how to make rows and columns and how it fit together. I experimented with adding col-1 etc. to the columns and then checked it in the small size. I found out that having a col-1 even made the column with wording really narrow. I really liked putting the image information in the style sheet. Thanks for the great coarse, the reference materials now make sense seeing the big picture. I have had a lot of fun doing crazy artistic stuff. 

# Assignment 14
## Janet HIGGINS

1. What library did you choose? I chose Bootstrap. I have used it with Dreamweaver before.
2. Did you use a local file or CDN? Why? I down loaded it and chose only the bootstrap.min.css and the bootstrap.min.js files.
3. How does HTML5 change the web? I think that the web is more dynamic using the more javascript. 
4. Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how 
you overcame them. My biggest challeng was with the javascript. Even following a tutorial was impossible. So I chose to work in visual Studio. That helped a lot.
